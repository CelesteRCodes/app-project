  View List of All Movies
From the homepage, users should be able to click on View all movies 
and see a list of all movies in the database. In the list, users will 
be able to see each movie’s title. Also, if they click on a movie’s title, 
they’ll navigate to an info page about that particular movie.

Just to give you an idea of what you’re working toward, 
here’s how the page might look if you were to write it all by hand, in pure HTML:

<!doctype html>

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
