need to add a little AJAX to project


create new route, use variable parameter

    /plant_id/ or /plant_name/

@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')
def show_post(post_id):
    """Show the post with the given id, the id is an integer."""

    return f'Blog post #{post_id}'

in user-plants.html
make a link tag, have end of url the route (/growlog/plant_id)
          these are jinja variables 
          can use end of url to query db for all logs of specific plant 
          it's a string by default, need to make it an int 

plant-details.html will be connected to user-plants.html, 
linked just like plant-log.html and new-entry.html
each page is specific for plant

need to add these functions to add-plant.html, CRUD.py and in route in server.py
    {{ plant.germinate_date }}
    add a text form to new-plant.html

    {{ plant.transplant_date }}
    add a text form to new-plant.html

    {{ plant.growing_medium }}
    drop down menu added to new-plant.html with options
    (container, specialty: dwc/rdwc/aqua/aero, raised bed, direct sow)

    {{ plant.directsow }}
    radio button(direct sow, transplant)
    
    {{plant.location}}
    radio button 
    (indoor, outdoor)

    {{ plant.environment }}
    drop down menu added to new-plant.html with options
    (indoor, grow tent/room, windowsill, outdoor, greenhouse)

    {{ plant.lighting }}
    drop down menu added to new-plant.html with options

more tests
different kinds of test, one of each

integration tests:
