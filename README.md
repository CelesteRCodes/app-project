See Where Youâ€™ve Been And See How You Grow

# Description
A web app where users can log data, including photos, to document every step of their plant's growth. The idea is for the user to learn from past mistakes/mishaps. Learn from trial and error with the logs to reference in the future as needed.

* Set up a snapshot of most recent updates to plant-log.html that will be displayed on user-plants.html
